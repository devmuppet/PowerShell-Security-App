# Introduction #
Every of us knows it... you have to give remote control to some unknown person, you login with your admin credentail, maybe even daomain admin, so that person can do basically everything now behind your back. Or you use an unprivileged account for that remote control, but the questen if he has enough privileges to do basically anything.

Here Comes my Tool enters the game. You may use an uprevileged account but you can allways type your credentail into the application, which are not redable by the user and give him some of your power, to for exaple start and elevated shell or start an exe.

Many thanks to Berend and his script(https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/PowerShell-Script-410ef9df) i used to encrypt and decrypt settings so noone can change them, or if changed the program will be brocken, but yout at least know who broke it ^-^.
